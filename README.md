# Info 
In one of my classes, we were tasked with building a website, and it would be our portfolio. It was made with basic HTML and CSS. But this version takes it to the next level, and it is built with Gatsby, TypeScript, and Chakra UI. This is the source code for the website.

# Development

Before you start building, you'll need these dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[user]/Lavender
```

2. Change into the directory and install dependencies

```sh
cd lavender-gatsby && npm i --location=global gatsby-cli && npm install
```

3. Run the dev server

```sh
npm run dev
```

4. If you need to build and serve the static files, run this command

```sh
npm run build
npm run serve
```
